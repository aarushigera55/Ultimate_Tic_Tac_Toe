# Ultimate_Tic_Tac_Toe
Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a board game composed of nine tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3-by-3 grid. In the game implemented here, players take turns playing in the smaller tic-tac-toe boards until one of them wins in the either of the smaller boards.

Introduction

In this project I wrote an agent to play the game of Nine-Board Tic-Tac-Toe.

This game is played on a 3 x 3 array of 3 x 3 Tic-Tac-Toe boards. The first move is made by placing an X in a randomly chosen cell of a randomly chosen board. After that, the two players take turns placing an O or X alternately into an empty cell of the board corresponding to the cell of the previous move. (For example, if the previous move was into the upper right corner of a board, the next move must be made into the upper right board.)

The game is won by getting three-in-a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally in one of the nine boards. If a player is unable to make their move (because the relevant board is already full) the game ends in a draw.
